The resources I used were a variety of web articles: the ones linked in the assignment, w3schools, and resources from the Mobile App development class I have taken before.

My approach was to use Java and XML coding because they are the approach I am familiar with.

The main roachblock I am facing is building the project. Due to some circumstances, I am currently running Android Studio on a cheap laptop. I am required to take extra steps in installation but the process went awry. Even after spending a good chunk of my time, I could not get it to run properly before the due date. However, I believe the main components required for the assignment are all present and in working order.
